# BottleneckTransformer
In this project, we implemented the cutting-edge model architecture, BoTNet, introduced in the research paper \"<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11605'>Bottleneck Transformers for Visual Recognition</a>\" by Srinivas et al., repurposing it for image classification on CIFAR-10.
